  // hh-input and hh-pagination are the only pair Stencil's automatic
  // dependents-similarity bundler (optimizeBundlers) merges into one shared
  // lazy chunk. When 2+ tags share a chunk, its entryKey becomes
  // "tag1.tag2.entry" (dot-joined); lazyBundleIdPlugin.getBundleId() then
  // splits that string on "." to derive the physical filename, but its own
  // trailing ".entry" segment gets counted as if it were a third tag,
  // tripping `components.length > 2` and appending a spurious "_2" suffix
  // to the file Stencil actually writes to disk. Meanwhile dist/esm/index.js's
  // re-export map is built from the untouched tag list and points at the
  // un-suffixed name ("hh-input.hh-pagination.entry.js"), which doesn't
  // exist — breaking any consumer (Vite/Rollup) that resolves this package's
  // ESM entry. Confirmed reproducible on @stencil/core 4.44.2 with a clean
  // build (not a stale-cache artifact). Pinning these two into their own
  // single-component bundles keeps each entryKey single-tag ("hh-input.entry"),
  // which never hits the `> 2` branch, sidestepping the bug entirely.
