# Visual Quality

HANDHELD visual regression is defined by HANDHELD itself, not by comparison with another design system.

## State coverage

Components are captured in the states that apply to them:

- default
- hover
- active
- focus-visible
- disabled
- loading
- error
- light theme
- dark theme
- reduced motion

## Baseline policy

Baselines are generated from HANDHELD Storybook stories. They are deterministic artifacts and must only change when the visual contract intentionally changes.
